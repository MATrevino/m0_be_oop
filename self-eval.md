# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
Whew. This was a challenge. It's very helpful to look at others' codes durign this challenge. I did feel somewhat stuck though. I need to go back and look at the challenges again. I feel like 2/5 on this right now.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I can stay focus for about 1.5 -2 hours and I need a break. I haven't been very good about taking breaks outside and I need to commit to that more. I just feel like I get behind if I leave my desk... but my legs need it.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I need more practice. I would love to run through more of these during the next three weeks prior to mod 1. If there are any suggestions, that'd be great!
